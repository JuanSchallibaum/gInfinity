        <p>I know that you probably just want to start using all of the nice features of gInfinity, but if I can lend just 1 minute of your time, I would very much appreciate it. Doing software is harder and more time consuming than it looks. I live from making software and love doing it. Unfortunately I can't afford to work for free, why all of my software should be monetizable somehow. I'm sure you understand why and if not, try imagining yourself working for free. Not a happy though, right? :-)</p><br /><br />
